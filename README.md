# Hamden_Education_Foundation
This app was designed and developed for the Hamden Education Foundation, a non-profit organization for the Hamden Public School system. 
This app was built as a final project for the senior capstone and is intended to be used by the Hamden school system's students, teachers, and any other guest uesr. The admin side is intended to be used by the Hamden Education Foundation committee so they can perform their administrative activities. 
The web-app is hosted using 000 webhost but is using the free tier so emails do not work unfortunately. Here's the link to the website and webapp:
